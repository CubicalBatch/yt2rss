Any standard podcast app can subscribe to your feeds:

3. Videos will appear as episodes with thumbnails
4. Automatic updates based on your refresh interval

### Channel Configuration

Add new channels through the web interface or by editing `appdata/config/channels.yaml`:

```yaml
default_interval_hours: 24  # Default refresh interval for new channels
check_delay_seconds: 30     # Delay between video metadata checks to avoid rate limiting
channels:
  - name: example_channel
    url: https://www.youtube.com/@ExampleChannel
    max_episodes: 15
    download_delay_hours: 12
    refresh_interval_hours: 24  # Individual channel refresh interval
    sponsorblock_categories:
      - sponsor
      - selfpromo
